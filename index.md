        <h3>Floor Coatings</h3>
        <p>
          Floor coatings are applied to concrete to prevent rising damp. We also do industrial flooring to garages, workshops, hospitals, cowshed, and other areas. We advise on the type of floor coatings to be used to accommodate for your needs and budget. All our waterproofers are approved applicators, and on job completion and full payment producer statements will be issued for council.

        <h3>Fibreglass Decks and Flat Roofs</h3>
        <p>
          Because of its durable qualities, versatility is a point of difference for our fibreglass reinforced system; here it is applied as a sleek finish for a deck area and rooftop.
        </p>
        <p>
          It provides a strong floor as well as keeping the underside dry and safe from water damage.
