    “... An excellent job was done... I am most happy with the outcome - a floor that looks smooth and shiny, has a hard waterproof surface, and will not attract dust as bare concrete seems to do.”
  - Graham O'Dea, Customer of Total Waterproofing (2005) Ltd.

  “...satisfied with the job your men have done. You attended little repairs that were not obvious and that were not in your original quote but carried out with no extra charge. The roof looks perfect. A pleasure...”
- Roger Hamlin, Customer of Total Waterproofing (2005) Ltd.


“We have had the pleasure of working with Tony and his team from Total Waterproofing 2005 Limited for over ten years now. We have engaged their services on both incredibly intricate projects for a multi-million dollar homes to small renovations and one off bathroom repairs. Tony’s expertise and product knowledge is second to none. He is constantly up-skilling to ensure both him and his team are competent and up to date with current requirements. Tony is particularly good at communicating throughout the entirety of the job and meeting deadlines. Nothing is ever an issue, the job just gets done. The quality and accuracy of Totals workmanship is faultless and always at the right price, hence council authorities and all of our clients are always satisfied. I would not hesitate to recommend Total Waterproofing for any project, whether intricate or simplistic and I will be continuing a strong business relationship with them in the future.”
